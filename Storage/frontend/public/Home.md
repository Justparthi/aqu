# *About*
_Aquesa Solutions Private Limited's Storage Service is a feasible to use, scalable and flexible storage service which eliminates all the complexities in integrating cloud storage services into the developers brain children (softwares). The best part here is that, the service is always _**6$/mo**_ irrespective of the amount of storage being used. _**Ingress and Egress**_, _**Hourly billing**_, _**Hidden charges**_, etc all are eliminated. Only _**6$/mo**_, that's it._

# _API Guide_

_API for this storage is as simple as that. No external libraries or complex programs to be implemented. Only thing you have to do is to use the default libraries available in any programming language to send **HTTP-Request** to the backend server developed by us to perform **PLACE-RETRIEVE-AMEND-TRUNCATE (P.R.A.T)** on the data that is being generated by you._

_**Examples**_

```python
import requests

contents = ""

with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    url = "https://<key>.store.cloud.aquesa-solutions.com"
    data = {
        "payload": f.read()
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)
    
    f.close()

```
